# Exploratory Data Analysis of the CMS Healthcare Exchange

## Description
 
  Although the ACA was passed in 2010, it was not completely implemented until January 1, 2014 due to challenges. With the implementation of the exchange,the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)maintains a website with datafiles describing of all insurance programs that are eligible and/or participate. 
  
  The financial aspects of the dataset has been well documented by others.  My focus is exploring the  change social norms shown in the datasets for the first three years of their reporting existence (2014-2016). I planned to examine more factors but due to time and the size of the dataset, the emphasis was started on extended family relationships.

## Requirements

A copy of the datasets was pulled from [Kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/hhs/health-insurance-marketplace). The original dataset are hosted at [CMS.gov] (https://www.kaggle.com/hhs/health-insurance-marketplace).

  If a state chooses to offer their own healthcare exchange, they may post their data in their own repository instead of including it the summary data from CMS.
